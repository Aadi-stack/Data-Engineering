Steps in Google Colab
Install the graphviz library in your Colab notebook:
  !apt-get install -y graphviz
  
!pip install graphviz


  Execute the above code. The .render() function creates the diagram as a PNG file, and Image() displays it directly in Colab.

Adjust dataset column names if required to match your actual CSV structure.
