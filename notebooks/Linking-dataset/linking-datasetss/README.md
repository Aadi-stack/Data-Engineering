# Steps in Google Colab

1. Install the graphviz library in your Colab notebook:


!apt-get install -y graphviz

!pip install graphviz

2. Execute the above code. The .render() function creates the diagram as a PNG file, and Image() displays it directly in Colab.

3. Adjust dataset column names if required to match your CSV structure.

# Objective Recap

The goal of this diagram is to:

1. Visualize Data Relationships: Understand how datasets are interconnected for further analysis.
2. Guide Analytics: Inform potential queries and insights, like "Which symptoms are linked to specific medications?" or "How do patient demographics affect healthcare expenses?"
3. Improve Data Understanding: Ensure clear data flow for predictive modelling, visualization, or dashboards.
